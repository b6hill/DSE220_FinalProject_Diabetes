# DSE220_FinalProject_Diabetes
Final Project DSE220 - Diabetes data prediction

**Abstract**
In this project, we explore the use of machine learning techniques for diabetes prediction. This Diabetes Health Indicators dataset from the CDC captures health and lifestyle information from patients and classifies them into one of three categories: diabetic, pre-diabetic, or healthy. The dataset contains 253,680 entries (each entry corresponding to one person in the study) and 21 features. These features include a wide range of indicators, such as demographics (age, income), vital signs (BMI, blood pressure), and lifestyle factors (physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption). Our goal is to use all these factors to predict if a person is diabetic, pre-diabetic, or healthy by creating a model that uses the most important risk factors for diabetes. These findings can be used to inform and improve the lives of the general public.

**Environment setup**
We are running our project in Google Colab - recommended to also run the code there as well, as this should be seemless. However if you do chose to run this in your own notebook environment we have provided a requirements.txt
